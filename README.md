# Concepts learnt and applied in this project
- **Enums (Enumerations):**
    - User-defined data types that consist of a set of named integer constants.
    - Used to make code more readable by replacing magic numbers with meaningful names.
- **Classes & Objects:**
    - **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects.
    - **Object:** An instance of a class containing its own data and behaviour.
    - **Methods:** Functions that belong to a class.
    - **Attributes:** Variables that belong to a class.
- **Constructors:**
    - Special methods that are automatically called when an object is instantiated.
    - Used primarily to initialize object attributes.
    - They share the same name as the class and have no return type.
- **Constructor Overloading:**
    - Defining multiple constructors with the same name but different parameters.
    - Allows flexibility in how objects are initialized.
- **Encapsulation (Getters & Setters):**
    - **Private Access Modifier:** Restricting direct access to class attributes to protect data integrity.
    - **Getters (Accessors):** Public methods to read private attributes.
    - **Setters (Mutators):** Public methods to modify private attributes, often including logic to validate the data.
- **Inheritance:**
    - A mechanism where a new class (Child/Derived) derives attributes and methods from an existing class (Parent/Base).
    - Promotes code reusability.
